this is my first project of git 

git init

this is the first step to initialize git in repository where we want to add all the files in staging area 
________________________________________________________________

git add file.txt

it will help to add file in stagging area
__________________________________________________

git log

to see logs in details 

________________

git log --oneline 

it will show details in oneline

git log --oneline file_name.extenstion

this will give logs of specific file
__________________________________________________

git reflog file_name

it will show all the details in formate of arrany like HEAD1 is pointing to shaid of particular commit.
using which we can find the specific details of the file , like content of file

_____________________________________________________________

what is diffrence between the command which is having keyword Global and without Global Keyword.
1. git config --global user.name "Vaishali"
2. git config user.name "Vaishali"

The 2nd command's scope is restricted to current directory only, if we are using branching then it will not work
the 1st command's scope is every where , it means we can use it in branching as well
_____________________________________________________________________________

git commit --amend -m "Git Knowledge file is created"

This command will work only on the commit which is pointed by head.
___________________________________________________________________

$ git restore --staged index.html

This command we use in order unstage the file if we added it staged area

______________________________________________________________________________

$ git restore index.html

before adding index.html in stagging area , if we want to go on previous file , then we can use this command 

_____________________________________________________________________________________________

git check -b new_barnch old_branch 
This will create new brach and also fetch all the data from old branch in it
