this is my first project of git 
what is diffrence between the command which is having keyword Global and without Global Keyword.
1. git config --global user.name "Vaishali"
2. git config user.name "Vaishali"

The 2nd command's scope is restricted to current directory only, if we are using branching then it will not work
the 1st command's scope is every where , it means we can use it in branching as well
