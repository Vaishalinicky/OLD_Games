this is my first project of git 

git init

this is the first step to initialize git in repository where we want to add all the files in staging area 
________________________________________________________________

git add file.txt

it will help to add file in stagging area
__________________________________________________

git log

to see logs

________________

git log --oneline 


_____________________________________________________________

what is diffrence between the command which is having keyword Global and without Global Keyword.
1. git config --global user.name "Vaishali"
2. git config user.name "Vaishali"

The 2nd command's scope is restricted to current directory only, if we are using branching then it will not work
the 1st command's scope is every where , it means we can use it in branching as well
_____________________________________________________________________________

git commit --amend -m "Git Knowledge file is created"

This command will work only on the commit which is pointed by head.
